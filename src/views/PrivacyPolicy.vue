      Account
      Registration. When you create an account with ILIft, we collect
      the information you provide us, such as your name, email address,
      phone number and Gender. So, Driver and Passengers do this simply
      steps to Set your initial location on a map, set your destination
      location on a map, Set the payment and booking schedule, and confirm.
      No worries, drivers accept cash. A nearby driver calls you after
      accepting the order to verify your exact location. You can also see
      the driver’s picture, vehicle license plate and side numbers, and a
      brief info on the driver. After completing a trip, you can request a
      paper-based receipt, or review our e-receipt sent out to your email
      automatically, upon payment confirmation. You may choose to share
      additional info with us for your Rider, like your photo or saved
      addresses (e.g., home or work), and set up other preferences (such as
      your preferred pronouns).
